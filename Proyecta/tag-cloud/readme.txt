By downloading our Tag Cloud FX you have access to one of the most customizable Flash component on the internet. All of our components are XML driven, so there is no need to use Adobe Flash to change the component's attributes or its assets.
The easiest way to start customizing our product is with its LiveDemo, which has all the component's attributes available.
To read more about how Flash components work with XML files, and get a good understanding of how our components work please visit this FAQ: www.flashxml.net/short-explanation-on-how-fx-components-read-xml-files.html
Most of our users want to use our component from a different folder than the location of the HTML page. To see how to embed a component that's in a different folder than your page please read www.flashxml.net/path-issues-with-swf-files-configured-via-xml.html
Since most of our users need to use special characters in their text fields we have created a special FAQ just for this: www.flashxml.net/special-characters-for-fx-components.html
