# Proyecta
ProyecTA is a twitter-like website created in 2011. Was made to addresses the complain and issues of the company with anonimousity. Was a real good idea but with no much success.

It's a normal website, if you want to see it just change the db access in dbcon.php. Doesn't use mysqli_query() though, so you may have to change that too.

The JAR file it's the autentication bridge between LDAP and the website, I think it was one of the innovations of the website, you log in it and it automatically authenticates with the LDAP user that was using the PC.
